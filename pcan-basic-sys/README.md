The [binaries and kernel driver](https://www.peak-system.com/quick/DrvSetup) of the library are not provided by this crate and must be installed seperately.

Following information on the PCAN-Basic API is copied from `ReadMe.txt` of the [PCAN-Basic API package](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Basic.239.0.html)

## Introduction

> The PCAN system of the company PEAK-System Technik GmbH consists of a
> collection of Windows Device Drivers. These allow the Real-time connection of
> Windows applications to all CAN busses that are physically connected to the PC
> via a PCAN hardware.
> 
> PCAN-Basic is a simple programming interface to the PCAN system. Via one
> Interface DLL it is possible to connect own applications to the Device drivers
> and the PCAN hardware, to communicate with the CAN busses.
> 
> The provided drivers, the PCAN-Basic API, and the PCAN-View CAN bus Monitor
> software are the feature-reduced versions of the larger software packages
> PCAN-Developer or PCAN-Explorer. These can be aquired separately.
